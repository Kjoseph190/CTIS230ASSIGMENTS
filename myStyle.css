<h1>A young boy who succeed on losing weight</h2>
<p>It’s Monday June 5th, 2017!!</p>
<p>This 13 year old boy named Kadeem Woke up from his nap, checked his phone to see if someone texted him when he was sleeping.</p>
<p>He didn’t want to get up to get ready for school but he knows his mom already, she doesn't play on him being late for school.</p>
<p>He got up from his comfy bed.</p>
<p>He walked to the bathroom to go brush his teeth because when he smelled his breath, it was kicking real bad.</p>
<p>Looking at himself in the mirror while brushing his teeth, he realized how fat he is but he didn’t care at that point so he continued doing him.</p>
<p> Now, he’s running late. He went back to his room to change his clothes, he kissed his mom goodbye and went to catch the bus that was 5 mins away from the closest bus stop near his house.</p>
<p> He started running fast up the road because that came so fast and at that speed it was coming, I was like “ohhh hell nah”.</p>
<p>I made it but I was so mad about myself.</p>
<p>I started sweating.</p>
<p>Knowing me I sweat so easily.</p>
<p>I’m in there huffing and puffing.</p>
<p> People started to stare at me in a side-eye way.</p>

<p>It’s 7:45 am now.</p>
<p>Kadeem is still on the bus heading to the train station.</p>
<p>All of the sudden, there’s traffic. </p>
<P>The earliest time to be at school is before 7:59am.</P>
<p>After 7:59am you are going to be marked late.</p>
<p>He finally got off the bus, now he had to walk fast to the train station.</p>
<p>He got downstairs to go to the platform, and looked at the screen to see what time the train would come.</p>
<p> That shit said 10 mins.</p>
<p>Mind you the time now is 7:50 am and I’m supposed to be at school at 7:59 before they mark me late for school.</p>
<p>Kadeem is standing there anxiously because he knows for a fact that he’s going to be late.</p>
<p> He’s looking at his phone every 30 seconds expecting the train to come even sooner so I don’t hear my mom's mouth.</p>
<p>I’m stressed, I know my mom is going to be mad at me when she gets a notification from school saying “Kadeem got marked tardy “.</p>
<p> At that point, he saying fuck it, he can’t do anything anymore, he’s going to get the yelling over with it and call it a day.</p>
<p>Kadeem got to school late, he went to class, sat down and got his pencil ready to catch up what he missed in the first half of class.</p>
<p> His first period and second wasn’t bad at all until he reached his 3rd period class.</p>
<p>The students started to bully him about his weight and he didn’t like that comment at all.</p>
<p>It happened throughout his 3rd, 4th and 5th period.</p>
<p>He didn’t want to express his emotions because he knows for a fact that they are going to keep clowning him over and over again.</p>
<p>Kadeem went to the bathroom and he started tearing up and texted his mom about what’s going on in class.</p>
<p>Kadeem’s mom called the school, the teacher pulled me to the side and asked him “ what’s going on “.</p>
<p> He didn’t want to tell them what’s going on but at the same time he wanted these kids to stop calling him names.</p>
<p> The kids who were bullying him from that time, they got in school suspension for a day.</p>
