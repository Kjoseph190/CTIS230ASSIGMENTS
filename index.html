<h1>College/Professional Basketball Athlete ACL Injuries</h1>
<p>Looking at College/Professional Basketball Athletes, when they get injured, it's very hurtful and sad at the sametime because you don't know what’s going to happen from now to the next step after that scary injury.</p>
<p>That injury is called an ACL injury.</p>
<p>This injury is temporary and permitted overtime.</p>
<p>This depends on how bad you landed or how many times you pop it when you're playing physical Basketball.</P>
<p> For college students when they pop their ACL, their whole career being a NBA player could be in jeopardy after that incident because they will have so many offers now that could decrease rapidly over one terrible injury. For professional athletes it is similar but is just a lil bit.</P>

<li> <p>In professional athletes if they pop their ACL, they can try and get surgery and miss a year and a half of the season with pay or if the injury is really bad, that player needs to retire asap.</p>
     <p>These talks about ACL injuries have been going for years now towards known Basketball players and unknown basketball.</p>
     <p>ACL injury occurs when they stop and quickly change directions while they’re running.</p>
     <p>People who play soccer, football, tennis, basketball or volleyball, or who do gymnastics are more likely to twist their knees by mistake when they compete than, say, cross-country runners, who simply move forward at a steady pace.</p>
     <p>Your speed combined with the way that you twist or turn your knee will make it likely that you’ll stretch or tear your ACL.</P>

<Li> <p>I can relate to this because one of my family members in college tore his ACL so he had to get surgery but recovery is a year to try to get back on the court.</p>
     <p>My cousin was telling me that he was in pain throughout the process.</p>
     <p>When he went through that, I prayed I wouldn't get that type of injury.</p>
     <p>All my life, I went through alot of ankle injuries and the pain was painful to me so I don't want to go through what you went through.</p>
     <p>To prevent an ACL injury there's different steps you have to take so you can’t get that type of injury easily.</p>
     <p>So, you never let your knees collapse inward, Develop strength in your hips and thighs, Warm up and stretch before games and practice.</p>


<Li> <p>The best way to develop good form is to perform a variety of drills until the movement patterns are second nature and you don’t have to think about it.</p>
     <p>While exercising or doing the drills, keep these thoughts in mind:</P>
     <p>Keep your chest high and over your knees.</p>
     <p>Bend from the hips and knees.</p>
     <p>Point toes straight forward.</p>
     <p>Land like a feather.</p>
     <p>I said No towards my body of research surrounding your issue is going to be too large to undertake in just one semester because you can find stuff about these athletics injuries and you can find out how you can prevent it from happening again.</p>
     <p>I Have narrowed it down to something specific enough to hone in on over the next few months.</p>
     <p>I believe my chosen topic isn't going to be too broad because I talked about men's college/professional Basketball tearing their ACL.</p>
