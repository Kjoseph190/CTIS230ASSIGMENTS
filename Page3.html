<h1>Spanish Class</h1>
<p>I am a sophomore student. I'm in high school trying to get my education so I can go to college to make my mother and my other family proud.</p>
<P> The teacher assigned me to a Spanish class.</P>
<p>I was kinda excited because I was able to learn more about it and before I wanted to learn spanish.</p>
<p> Now, I changed my mind.</P>
<p>I only know the basics and not the complex ones.</p>
<p> First off, I was nervous because when I messed up, I felt like people were whispering underneath their breath.</p>

<p> I walked in class, the teacher introducing herself to us.</p>
<P>She is here talking about where she is from and why she chose this school.</p>
<p>The teacher seemed cool for the week before she started giving us homework day after day.</p>
<P>Spanish class can be the most difficult/uncomfortable class I ever attended because you felt like you were being focused to learn about a new language knowing that it was going to be hard because some people in the class knew the most complex word.</P>
<p>Yeah, I know the basics in Spanish but to try and make a sentence is hard. I remember getting mad at myself for trying to say the word correctly.</P>
<p> I don’t want to give up but with that I would. You have to get the spelling correctly.</p>
<p>It was just a lot for me to handle.</p>
<p> I can connect to Amy Tan because she was struggling with language.</P>
<p>She said it can evoke emotion, visual image, a complex idea, or a simple truth. So I can relate back to her</p>

<p>Sometimes learning a different language can't be so bad because I heard, if you know how to speak it, etc.</p>
<p>You can get a scholarship for just knowing a language you ain’t primary in.</P>
<p>On the bright side, you can benefit so much from learning a difficult language you don’t feel comfortable in.</p>
