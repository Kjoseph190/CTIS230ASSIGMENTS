    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Kadeem,i'm 20 year old and I just started picking up a camera beginning of Jan 8th 2024.</p>
    <p>I started making my intergram page (KJVISION_) and I asked my friends to repost it and support me all the way and they all believe in me.</p> <p>Asking one of my friend in north carolina to help me so I can practice and practice.</p>
    <p>For the time i've practice and practice, the results came out what I'm expecrting in my long term doing this and for my future customers.</p>
    <p> Through my lens, I hope to produce outcomes that will make you say, "Woww, Thats firee" or "I really love it".</p>
