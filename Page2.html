<h1>A memory about my first basketball game</h1>
<p class="intro">Back in October 2022, It was a windy Wednesday morning, I woke up from bed super hype about my first basketball game of the season.</p>
<p>I heard a lot about this team name Transit but I ain't let that bother me the whole day.</p>
<P>I’m getting ready for school doing the regular things I do every day.</P>
<p>I wake up, take a shower, wash my face, brush my teeth, and lotion my body.</p>
<p>Wait, I can't forget about the cologne because you gotta smell good when I leave that crib.</p>
<P>Anyways, I’m walking to the bus stop and all of a sudden these people ( it was like 5 people )  that go to transit came up to me and said “Yooo, you go to AF, I was like “ Why” and they replied “ Your bum ass team going to get fried up, yall ass”.</P>
<p> I responded saying “ shut the fuck up, I got a good team, imma drop 15 on yall head, Watch and see”.</p>
<P>Now I'm tight. They really messed up my whole day.</P>
<p> I was in my feelings when I got to school.</p>

<P>The teachers and students want to know what’s going on with me because they ain’t seen me like that before because every time I walk in school I always bring out a lot of energy/joy.</P>
<p> My best friend came up to me and asked me “What’s wrong, talk to me Kadeem, everything is okay.</p>
<p>I shook my head up and down to tell her yeah and I went back to what I was doing.</p>
<P>She came up running after me and stopped me from doing what I was doing.</P>
<p>She responded by saying “ Kadeem, I’m your best friend, why are you acting like that, tell me what’s going on”.</p>
<P> In my head, I was like she’s my best friend for 18 years so imma tell her what’s going on.</P>
<p> I told her what was going on and she said “When you go to the game, you better put that anger you got right now on the court, I want you to try your best, you got this”.</p>
<P> We did our handshake, I hugged her and I responded saying “ I will!!</P>
<p>I appreciate you for really checking up on me.</p>
<p>I'm sorry for acting like that towards you.</p>
<P>My best friend replied “It’s okay best friend, I fully understand.</P>
<P>School just ended, I went to my gym to get some shots up before we traveled 40 minutes to the school.</P>
<P> I had one of my other teammates help me rebound for me but we decided to rotate every rep so we both could be involved.</P>
<P>We finished everything we had to do.</P>
<P>Now it’s time to put our traveling outfit on to go to the game.</P>
<P> We were leaving the school and all of a sudden rain started to pour.</P>
<P>The train got delayed and the bus wanted to do the same.</P>
